This project was built in SENAI technical school with the following goals:

- Learn about Vue.js and it's application; 
- Learn about the API consuming and the relation between data startin from it to another web sites;
- Learn with practice the concept of Components and Modules

The following websites were used in the project:

- [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/ "Star Wars API")

## Two ways, one goal

Both projects are equal in goals, but made differently. One using a vue file and other using module programming. Both are limited to be used in Chrome browser, due to the stars effect.

### Vue Framework Project

In this folder, there's a few files using a separeted Vue file and applying the concepts using with an external js file with the commands.

### Vue Server Side

To use that, must be created a Vue App, first **installing Node.js** and after **creating the vue app** by vue cli installation. More information can be found in the [Vue Documentation Website](https://vuejs.org/ "Vue Documentation Website") and install Node.js (npm included) in the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js Official Website")
